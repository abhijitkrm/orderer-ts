# JOURNAL — orderer journals, snapshots and recovery v1

Extends matcher's `spec/matcher/JOURNAL.md`. Command and event lines,
snapshot format and determinism argument are matcher's. This document adds
what the pipeline needs:

- per-partition files
- an `iseq` watermark on command records
- a fixed-layout binary encoding
- a snapshot sidecar
- the recovery procedure

Vectors: `vectors/pipeline/`, `vectors/journal/`, `vectors/recovery/`.

## 1. Files

A journal directory holds, for each partition `p` in `0 … P-1` (decimal, no
padding):

| Format | Command journal | Event journal |
|---|---|---|
| `jsonl` | `cmd-{p}.journal` | `evt-{p}.journal` |
| `binary` | `cmd-{p}.bin` | `evt-{p}.bin` |

All `P` pairs exist even when a partition receives no commands. Such files
hold only their header.

## 2. Command journal

One record per command routed to the partition, in ingress order
(`PIPELINE.md` §3.2), written before the command is applied
(`PIPELINE.md` §4).

### 2.1 JSONL

Line 1 is the header. It carries the writing pipeline's default book
config, with matcher's key names, so journals are self-describing:

```json
{"format":"orderer-journal/1","kind":"cmd","partition":0,"partitions":4,"pmin":0,"pmax":1000000,"max_orders":65536,"index":"ladder"}
```

Each later line is matcher's canonical engine command line
(`spec/matcher/SCHEMA.md`, `"symbol"` after `"cmd"`) with `"iseq":N`
appended as the **last** key:

```json
{"cmd":"new","symbol":10,"order_id":1,"side":"bid","otype":"limit","price":100,"qty":10,"tif":"gtc","iseq":1}
{"cmd":"cancel","symbol":10,"order_id":1,"iseq":4}
{"cmd":"replace","symbol":6,"order_id":3,"price":101,"qty":5,"iseq":7}
```

Matcher's flat readers look keys up by name. They read these lines
unchanged and ignore `iseq` and the header (matcher `JOURNAL.md` §4). A
journal tail can therefore be replayed by a matcher implementation.

Market orders keep matcher's canonical form: `"otype":"market"` with the
`price` and `tif` the command carried.

### 2.2 Binary

All integers are **little-endian**. Signed values are two's complement.
The file starts with a 64-byte header, followed by fixed-size records.

**Header (64 bytes, both kinds):**

| Offset | Size | Field | Value |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | magic | ASCII `ORDJ` (`4F 52 44 4A`) |
| 4 | 2 | version | `1` |
| 6 | 1 | kind | `1` = cmd, `2` = evt |
| 7 | 1 | index | `0` = ladder, `1` = tree |
| 8 | 4 | partition | `p` |
| 12 | 4 | partitions | `P` |
| 16 | 4 | record_size | `40` (cmd) or `48` (evt) |
| 20 | 4 | reserved | zeros |
| 24 | 8 | pmin | i64 |
| 32 | 8 | pmax | i64 |
| 40 | 8 | max_orders | u64 |
| 48 | 16 | reserved | zeros |

**Command record (40 bytes):**

| Offset | Size | Field | Encoding |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | iseq | u64 |
| 8 | 4 | symbol | u32 |
| 12 | 1 | cmd | `1` new · `2` cancel · `3` replace |
| 13 | 1 | side | `0` bid · `1` ask (new only, else `0`) |
| 14 | 1 | otype | `0` limit · `1` market (new only, else `0`) |
| 15 | 1 | tif | `0` gtc · `1` ioc · `2` fok · `3` post_only (new only, else `0`) |
| 16 | 8 | order_id | u64 |
| 24 | 8 | price | i64 (new, replace; cancel `0`) |
| 32 | 8 | qty | u64 (new, replace; cancel `0`) |

## 3. Event journal

One record per event emitted by the partition's engine, in emission order.

### 3.1 JSONL

The header is as §2.1 with `"kind":"evt"`. Each later line is matcher's
canonical **symbol-tagged** event line, byte-for-byte
(`spec/matcher/SCHEMA.md`, `engine:true` form). It has no `iseq`, so event
journals are directly comparable with matcher engine output.

```json
{"format":"orderer-journal/1","kind":"evt","partition":0,"partitions":4,"pmin":0,"pmax":1000000,"max_orders":65536,"index":"ladder"}
{"seq":1,"ev":"accepted","symbol":10,"order_id":1,"leaves_qty":10}
```

### 3.2 Binary

The header is as §2.2 with kind `2` and record_size `48`.

The JSONL and binary headers carry the same fields. Every file of one
journal directory must agree on `partitions` and the book config.

**Event record (48 bytes):**

| Offset | Size | Field | Encoding |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | seq | u64, per-book sequence |
| 8 | 4 | symbol | u32 |
| 12 | 1 | ev | `1` accepted · `2` rejected · `3` trade · `4` closed · `5` replaced |
| 13 | 1 | reason | rejected: `1` invalid_qty · `2` invalid_price · `3` duplicate_order_id · `4` unknown_order_id · `5` post_only_would_cross · `6` fok_cannot_fill · `7` book_full; closed: `1` filled · `2` cancelled · `3` expired; otherwise `0` |
| 14 | 2 | reserved | `0` |
| 16 | 8 | a | u64 |
| 24 | 8 | b | u64 |
| 32 | 8 | c | i64 |
| 40 | 8 | d | u64 |

| ev | a | b | c | d |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| accepted | order_id | 0 | 0 | leaves_qty |
| rejected | order_id | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| trade | maker | taker | price | qty |
| closed | order_id | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| replaced | order_id | 0 | price | qty |

Binary and JSONL encode the same information. Converting either to the
other is lossless, and `vectors/journal/` pins both encodings of the same
runs.

## 4. Snapshots

An orderer snapshot is **one** `matcher-snap/1` document (matcher
`JOURNAL.md` §3) plus a sidecar.

- **Body.** It is exactly the snapshot a single matcher `Engine` would write
  for the same books: one header line with the pipeline's default book
  config, then every book's block in **ascending symbol order** across all
  partitions. Implementations may capture partitions separately but must
  merge into this form. The body is therefore independent of `P` and
  byte-identical to matcher's snapshot of the same state.
- **Sidecar** at `<snapshot path>.meta`, one line plus newline:

  ```json
  {"format":"orderer-meta/1","iseq":120,"partitions":4}
  ```

  `iseq` is the cut: the snapshot reflects exactly the commands with
  `iseq ≤ 120` (`PIPELINE.md` §6). `partitions` records the writer's `P`,
  for information only.
- A snapshot taken before any command has `"iseq":0`.

**Restore.** Parse the body. Route each book to its partition under the
*restoring* pipeline's `P` and table (`ROUTING.md`), and restore it there
(matcher `JOURNAL.md` §3 restore semantics). Restoring under a different
`P` is valid.

## 5. Recovery

Inputs: an optional snapshot with its sidecar (cut `N`; no snapshot means
`N = 0` and empty books), and a journal directory.

1. Determine the book config. With a snapshot, use its header; the
   journals' headers must match it, or recovery fails. Without one, use the
   journals' headers.
2. Restore the snapshot (§4).
3. Read every partition's command journal. Records must have strictly
   increasing `iseq` within each file.
4. Merge all records by `iseq` (they are disjoint across partitions). Drop
   records with `iseq ≤ N`.
5. Apply the remaining records in `iseq` order, through the pipeline or
   directly through engines routed per `ROUTING.md`.
6. Resume sequencing at `max(N, highest replayed iseq) + 1`.

Determinism (matcher `SPEC.md` §7) guarantees the replayed events are
byte-identical to the original event journal's records for those commands.
`orderrecover` exists to prove it (`HARNESS.md`).

**Torn and corrupt journals are errors.** Recovery must fail loudly rather
than diverge silently. The following are corruption, and harnesses exit 2:

- JSONL: a final line without a newline, or any record line that does not
  parse.
- Binary: a body length that is not a multiple of `record_size`, a bad magic
  or version, or a header whose partition or kind does not match the file
  name.
- Headers in one directory that disagree on `partitions` or the book config.
- Non-increasing `iseq` within a file.
